# C Programs

A collection of C programs for learning and practicing the fundamentals of C. This repository also serves as a storage for my coursework. Click on the little arrow [↗] to jump to the relevant program.

## **Programs List**
1. **Factorial of a number.** [[↗]](programs/factorial.c)  
2. **Sum of all odd/even numbers between 1-100.** [[↗]](programs/sum_oddeven.c)  
3. **Sum of numbers divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11 between 1-100.** [[↗]](programs/sum_divisibleby_3_5_7_11.c)  
4. **Sum of the digits of a number.** (e.g., `56 → 5+6=11`) [[↗]](programs/sum_digits.c)
5. **C Program to check if a number is Armstrong or not.** An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the total number of digits. [[↗]](programs/armstrong.c)
6. **C program to print the fibonacci sequence.** [[↗]](programs/fibonacci.c)
7. **C Program to check if a number is prime or not.** [[↗]](programs/prime.c)
8. **C program to calculate sum of the following series:** 
   - s = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + n [[↗]](programs/sum_series1.c)
   - s = 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + n [[↗]](programs/sum_series2.c)
   - s = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n [[↗]](programs/sum_series3.c)  
   - s = 1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + ... + 1/n [[↗]](programs/sum_series4.c)
9. **C program to find the biggest number among 3 numbers.** [[↗]](programs/biggestnumber.c)
10. **C program to generate first 10 positive integers that are divisible by 3/5/11.** [[↗]](programs/generate10integers.c)
