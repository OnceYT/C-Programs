# C Programs

A collection of C programs for learning and practicing the fundamentals of C. This repository also serves as a storage for my coursework. Click on the little arrow [↗] to jump to the relevant program.

## **Programs List**

1. **C program to find factorial of any number.** [[↗]](programs/factorial.c)  
2. **C program to find sum of all odd/even numbers between 1-100.** [[↗]](programs/sum_oddeven.c)  
3. **C program to find sum of those numbers which are divisible by 3/5/7/11 in between 1-100.** [[↗]](programs/sum_divisibleby_3_5_7_11.c)
